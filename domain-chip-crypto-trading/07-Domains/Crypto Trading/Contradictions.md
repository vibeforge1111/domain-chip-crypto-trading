# Contradictions

This page is the trading equivalent of a `why it lost` surface.

Track failure shapes here when a combination looks exciting but should not be promoted.

## btc-15m-volatility-compression-breakout-psychology_no_chase

- doctrine_id: `breakout_volatility_expansion`
- strategy_id: `breakout_open_interest_confirmation`
- priority: `0.99`
- holdout_profitability_score: `0.3133`
- walk_forward_consistency: `0.0`
- stress_resilience: `0.0`
- max_drawdown: `0.99`
- contradiction: Use the benchmark failure surface itself as the next mutation source instead of adding a fresh doctrine blindly.

### Failure Modes

- sparse_signal: Trade count stays below the minimum gate, so the candidate may be a local curve rather than a repeatable contract edge.
- holdout_decay: The final holdout slice drops below break-even profitability after fees.
- segment_instability: Walk-forward consistency is too low across chronological splits.
- execution_fragility: Edge does not survive elevated fees and slippage cleanly.
- drawdown_excess: Drawdown remains above the promotion boundary even when trade count is adequate.

### Weakest Segments

- wf-4: profitability=`0.0` avg_return=`-1.04` trades=`2`
- wf-1: profitability=`0.0` avg_return=`0.0` trades=`0`

## Anti-Patterns

- high PnL with unstable drawdown
- strategy wins that do not transfer across adjacent regimes
- doctrine labels attached after the fact to justify a curve fit
- paper-trade enthusiasm outrunning benchmark evidence
